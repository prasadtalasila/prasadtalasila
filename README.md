### Hi there 👋

I am a researcher and software developer in the Software Engineering and Computing Systems (SECS) group,
Department of ECE, Aarhus University. My [personal website](http://prasad.talasila.in) tells you more.

### Collaboration 🤝

🔭 I’m currently working on ...[Digital Twin as a Service](https://github.com/into-cps-association/DTaaS) project.
That is an excellent place to explore collaboration opportunity.

👨‍🔬 These days I spend time researching and prototyping ideas on Digital Twins, Cyber Physical Systems
and Distributed Computing for Manufacturing SMEs. You will find more details from
[my scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=53B5RKoAAAAJ&hl=da&oi=ao).

🤹‍♂️ I'm always looking for interesting commercial problems to apply my professional expertise. I have been consulting
with companies for the past five years. This is an area of enduring interest to me.
